# Signal Impairments

## **Attenuation**
- **Definition:**  
  The gradual loss of signal strength as it travels through a transmission medium.
  ![[Pasted image 20241130220200.png]]
- **Cause:**  
  Energy dissipation due to resistance in the medium or distance.
- **Impact:**  
  Weak signals may become undetectable at the receiver.
- **Solution:**  
  Amplifiers or repeaters are used to boost signal strength.
- **Example:**  
  A signal that starts at 10 dBm and drops to 2 dBm after traveling a certain distance experiences attenuation.

## **Distortion**
- **Definition:**  
  The alteration of the original shape or characteristics of a signal as it propagates.
- **Cause:**  
  Different frequency components of a signal travel at different speeds in the medium (frequency-dependent delay).
- **Impact:**  
  Leads to misinterpretation of the data at the receiver.
- **Solution:**  
  Equalizers or advanced modulation techniques can help reduce distortion.
- **Example:**  
  Audio signals might sound muffled or unclear due to distortion.

## **Noise**
- **Definition:**  
  Any unwanted external signal or interference that affects the quality of the transmitted signal.
- **Types of Noise:**
  1. **Thermal Noise:** Caused by random motion of electrons in conductors.
  2. **Intermodulation Noise:** Caused by mixing of two or more signals.
  3. **Crosstalk:** Signals in adjacent wires interfere with each other.
  4. **Impulse Noise:** Sudden, high-amplitude interference.
- **Impact:**  
  Reduces the clarity and reliability of the transmitted signal.
- **Solution:**  
  Shielding cables, noise filters, or error correction techniques.
- **Example:**  
  A crackling sound in a phone call is caused by noise.

## **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
- **Definition:**  
  The ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise, indicating signal clarity.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{SNR (in dB)} = 10 \times \log_{10} \left( \frac{\text{Signal Power}}{\text{Noise Power}} \right)
  \]
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Higher SNR indicates a cleaner and more distinguishable signal.
  - Lower SNR indicates higher noise interference.
- **Impact:**  
  Low SNR can lead to errors in data transmission.
