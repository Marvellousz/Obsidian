1. **IPv4 and IPv6**:
   - IPv4: 32-bit addressing (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
   - IPv6: 128-bit addressing to accommodate more devices (e.g., 2001:0db8::1).

2. **MAC Address**:
   - Unique hardware identifier for devices in a network (e.g., 00:14:22:01:23:45).

3. **Port Address and Port Number**:
   - Logical endpoints for specific processes or services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).
