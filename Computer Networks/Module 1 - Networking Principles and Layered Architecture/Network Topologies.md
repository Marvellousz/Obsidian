1. **Mesh**:
   - Each device connects to every other device.
   - Provides redundancy but is costly to implement.
   - Example: High-reliability networks like in data centers.

2. **Star**:
   - All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
   - Simple to implement and maintain.
   - Example: Common in office LANs.

3. **Bus**:
   - All devices share a single communication line.
   - Cost-effective but prone to collisions.
   - Example: Legacy Ethernet systems.

4. **Ring**:
   - Devices form a circular connection.
   - Data travels in one direction until it reaches its destination.
   - Example: Token Ring networks.
