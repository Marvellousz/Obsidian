**Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning the dataset contains only input features without associated output labels. The goal is to identify hidden patterns, groupings, or structure in the data.

### Key Characteristics of Unsupervised Learning:

1. **No Labels**: Unlike supervised learning, the training data does not include explicit outputs.
2. **Pattern Discovery**: The focus is on understanding the data's underlying structure, distribution, or relationships.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Often used for tasks where there is no prior knowledge of the data's behavior.

### Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems:

1. **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity.
    
    - Example: Customer segmentation, grouping news articles by topic.
    - Algorithms:
        - K-Means
        - Hierarchical Clustering
        - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in the data while retaining essential information.
    
    - Example: Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.
    - Algorithms:
        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
        - Autoencoders
3. **Association Rule Learning**: Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets.
    
    - Example: Market basket analysis (e.g., "customers who bought X often buy Y").
    - Algorithms:
        - Apriori
        - Eclat
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
    
    - Example: Fraud detection, network security.

### Unsupervised Learning Workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather raw, unlabeled data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data (e.g., normalization, handling missing values).
3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm based on the task (clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc.).
4. **Model Training**: Fit the algorithm to the data to uncover patterns.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model based on interpretability and performance (e.g., cluster coherence, explained variance).

### Popular Algorithms in Unsupervised Learning:

1. **K-Means Clustering**:
    
    - Partitions the data into kk clusters.
    - Requires specifying the number of clusters in advance.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
    
    - Builds a tree of clusters using either an agglomerative or divisive approach.
3. **DBSCAN**:
    
    - Groups points based on density; does not require specifying the number of clusters.
4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:
    
    - Reduces the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto a set of principal components.
5. **t-SNE**:
    
    - Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.
6. **Autoencoders**:
    
    - Neural networks designed for dimensionality reduction or feature learning.

### Example: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

1. **Input Data**: Customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
2. **Goal**: Group customers into distinct clusters (e.g., high spenders, occasional buyers).
3. **Process**:
    - Use a clustering algorithm like K-Means.
    - Evaluate the coherence of clusters (e.g., using silhouette scores).
    - Use the clusters to tailor marketing strategies.

### Applications:

- **Marketing**: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems.
- **Healthcare**: Grouping patients by symptoms for diagnosis.
- **Finance**: Anomaly detection in transaction data.
- **Technology**: Document organization, social network analysis.
