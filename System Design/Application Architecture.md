## Components and Interactions
1. **Developer (Dev):**
   - Builds and deploys application code to the server.

2. **Build & Deploy Code:**
   - Continuous integration and deployment process to manage application updates.
   - Ensures code is compiled, tested, and deployed efficiently.

3. **Server:**
   - Processes user requests and executes application logic.
   - Manages connections to storage and other servers.

4. **Storage:**
   - Persistent storage for application data.
   - Could include databases, file storage, or cloud storage solutions.

5. **Load Balancer:**
   - Distributes incoming user requests across multiple servers.
   - Ensures high availability and scalability of the application.

6. **Logging:**
   - Captures logs for debugging, auditing, and monitoring purposes.
   - Helps developers understand system behavior over time.

7. **Metrics:**
   - Monitors performance metrics like response time, CPU usage, or traffic volume.
   - Provides insights for system optimization.

8. **Alerts:**
   - Sends notifications when anomalies or issues are detected.
   - Triggered by metrics to inform developers of potential failures or downtimes.

## Data Flow
- **Dev to Server:** Code is built, tested, and deployed onto the server.
- **User to Load Balancer:** Users access the application through the load balancer, which routes their requests to available servers.
- **Server to Storage:** Servers fetch or save data to storage as needed.
- **Logging and Metrics:** Servers generate logs and metrics to monitor activity and performance.
- **Metrics to Alerts:** Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds in performance metrics.
