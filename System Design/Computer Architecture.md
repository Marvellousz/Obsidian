## Components and Interactions
1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit):**
   - Executes instructions from programs.
   - Directly interacts with **RAM** and **Cache**.

2. **RAM (Random Access Memory):**
   - Temporary storage for currently used data and instructions.
   - Directly accessed by the CPU for fast data retrieval.

3. **Cache (Memory Buffer):**
   - Located closer to the CPU than RAM.
   - Stores frequently used data to reduce latency.

4. **Disk (Storage):**
   - Long-term data storage (e.g., HDD or SSD).
   - Data is loaded into RAM for faster access when needed.

## Data Flow
- **Disk to RAM:** Data is read from the disk into RAM when required.
- **RAM to CPU:** The CPU fetches instructions or data from RAM for execution.
- **CPU and Cache:** The CPU frequently uses cache memory for faster access to critical data.

## Mooreâ€™s Law
- **Definition:** The number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power.
- **Implication in Computer Architecture:**
  - Smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient processors.
  - Increased integration of components like larger caches.
  - Enhanced performance of CPUs and memory management systems.
