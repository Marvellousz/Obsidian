## 1. What is a CDN?
A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver content (like web pages, images, videos, and other assets) to users more quickly and reliably. CDNs reduce latency and improve website performance by caching content closer to the user's location.

## 2. How Does a CDN Work?
1. **Caching**:  
   - CDN servers, called **edge servers**, store cached copies of website content.
   - When a user requests a resource, the CDN delivers it from the nearest edge server rather than the origin server.

2. **Geographical Distribution**:  
   - CDNs have multiple servers located worldwide to minimize the distance between the user and the server.

3. **Load Balancing**:  
   - Distributes user requests among multiple servers to avoid overloading any single server.

## 3. Benefits of Using a CDN
- **Faster Content Delivery**:  
  Reduces latency by serving content from servers closer to the user.
  
- **Reduced Bandwidth Costs**:  
  Offloads traffic from the origin server, reducing bandwidth usage.

- **Improved Website Availability**:  
  Handles high traffic volumes and mitigates server outages.

- **Enhanced Security**:  
  Protects against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by distributing traffic across servers.

- **SEO and User Experience**:  
  Faster loading times improve search engine rankings and user satisfaction.
