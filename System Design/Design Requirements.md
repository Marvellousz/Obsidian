# Application Design Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. **Move Data:**
   - Efficient mechanisms to transfer data between servers, storage, and users.
   - Use APIs or data pipelines for seamless integration.

2. **Store Data:**
   - Reliable and scalable storage systems (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, or file storage).
   - Support for backup and restoration to prevent data loss.

3. **Transform Data:**
   - Data transformation pipelines for cleaning, processing, and enriching data.
   - Utilize ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or real-time data transformation services.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### **Availability**
- Systems must be highly available, ensuring minimal downtime.
- Design for redundancy (e.g., multiple servers, failover systems).
- Use **Load Balancers** to distribute traffic and maintain service availability.

### **Service Level Objectives (SLO) and Service Level Agreements (SLA):**
- Define clear metrics for:
  - **SLO:** Target performance indicators (e.g., 99.9% uptime, <200ms latency).
  - **SLA:** Formal commitments to customers, including penalties for breaches.

### **Reliability**
- Ensure consistent performance and correctness under normal and peak conditions.
- Design with **fault tolerance** and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected failures.

### **Fault Tolerance**
- Implement strategies to detect and recover from system failures:
  - Redundant servers.
  - Graceful degradation (some services remain functional during partial outages).

### **Redundancy**
- Replicate data and services across multiple servers, regions, or data centers.
- Use RAID, distributed databases, or cloud-based solutions for redundant storage.

### **Throughput**
- Optimize the system to handle a high number of requests per second (RPS).
- Scale backend resources dynamically based on traffic patterns.

### **Vertical and Horizontal Scaling**
1. **Vertical Scaling:**
   - Upgrade individual servers (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk space).
   - Suitable for simpler setups but limited by hardware constraints.
   
2. **Horizontal Scaling:**
   - Add more servers to handle increased traffic.
   - Preferred for high scalability and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

### **Latency**
- Minimize response times for end-users:
  - Use caching (e.g., CDN, in-memory caches like Redis).
  - Optimize database queries and server-side processing.
  - Deploy services closer to users via edge computing or regional data centers.

## Summary
To design a robust application, prioritize availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability while ensuring low latency and high throughput. Align SLOs and SLAs with user expectations and build for redundancy and fault tolerance to mitigate failures. Combine vertical and horizontal scaling strategies for optimal performance under varying loads.
